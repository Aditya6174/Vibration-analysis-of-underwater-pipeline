# Vibration-analysis-of-underwater-pipeline
# We are trying to develop a software that detects any sort of leakage in an underwater pipeline with vibrational analysis of the stream . It's going to reduce human workload and fatality rates in dangerous situations. Currently we are developing the mechanism of the above referred software . Once developed , it's going to be coded in Python and tested practically.
